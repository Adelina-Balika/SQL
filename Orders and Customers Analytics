#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Length(orderid) =6
AND orderid <> 'ORDER ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone' 
AND Length(orderid) =6
AND orderid <> 'ORDER ID';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SSELECT DISTINCT C.acctnum AS feb_acctnum
FROM customers C
INNER JOIN FebSales S
ON C.order_id = S.orderID
AND Length(orderid) =6
AND orderid <> 'ORDER ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT DISTINCT
 MIN(price) AS Price,
Product 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product, price 
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT SUM(Quantity)*price AS total_revenue,
Product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product 
ORDER BY Product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
 SELECT 
Product,
sum(Quantity) as total_quantity,
SUM(Quantity)*price AS total_revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
select 
count(distinct cust.acctnum), 
avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

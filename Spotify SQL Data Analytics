# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL.

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#First I determined the avg popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track.
SELECT AVG(danceability), 
artist_name, track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY AVG(danceability) Asc;S

SELECT artist_name, popularity, track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity ASC 
LIMIT 100;

SELECT AVG(energy),
artist_name,
track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY AVG(energy) DESC
LIMIT 100;

#Then I determined who the Top 10 artists are by popularity
SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;

#then I determined which top 5 songs were the longest
SELECT artist_name,
duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata 
ORDER BY duration_ms DESC
LIMIT 5;

#Then i determined what's the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs? 
SELECT AVG(danceability) AS average, 
artist_name,
 track_name,
 popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY popularity Asc
LIMIT 10;

#Then I determined the how many tracks each artists have.
SELECT COUNT(track_id),
artist_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY artist_name;

#Then I Calculated the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table using a CTE. 
Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, show their name, 
their average popularity, and label them as a “Top Star”
WITH popularity_avg_CTE AS
( SELECT s.artist_name, 
AVG(s.popularity) AS avg_popularity
FROM Spotifydata s
GROUP BY artist_name
)
SELECT artist_name, 
avg_popularity,
'Top Star' AS tag 
FROM popularity_avg_CTE
WHERE avg_popularity >=90;
